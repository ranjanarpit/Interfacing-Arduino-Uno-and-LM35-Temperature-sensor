# Interfacing-Arduino-Uno-and-LM35-Temperature-sensor
Interface LM35 temp sensor assuming the sensor is connected to analog pin A0 with an Arduino Uno and control the onboard LED based on temp readings: When the temp falls below 30°C, make the onboard LED blink every 250 ms and If the temp rises above 30°C, make the onboard LED blink every 500 ms, without using Millis(), delay() and micros() function.
